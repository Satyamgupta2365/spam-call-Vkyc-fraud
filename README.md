# Combating Spam Calls, Deepfake Fraud, and VKYC Exploitation in Financial Services

## Overview
This project provides an AI-powered solution to detect and prevent spam calls, deepfake-based fraud, and exploitation of Video Know Your Customer (VKYC) systems using AWS services. The solution aims to enhance the security of financial services by leveraging real-time analysis and advanced AI techniques.

## Features
### 1. **Spam Call Detection and Prevention**
- Transcribes audio calls using **Amazon Transcribe**.
- Analyzes call transcripts with **Amazon Comprehend** to identify fraud indicators (e.g., phishing attempts or scam keywords).
- Provides real-time alerts or call blocking mechanisms.

### 2. **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**
- Detects manipulated facial features and voice patterns using **Amazon Rekognition**.
- Differentiates authentic users from AI-generated inputs during VKYC processes.

### 3. **Transaction Monitoring**
- Monitors transactions using **Amazon Fraud Detector** to detect anomalies and prevent fraudulent activities.

### 4. **Feedback Mechanism**
- Users can report spam or fraudulent activities to improve the detection system via feedback loops.

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon Transcribe**: Converts audio calls to text.
- **Amazon Comprehend**: Detects sentiment and keywords in transcripts.
- **Amazon Rekognition**: Detects faces and deepfake manipulation in images and videos.
- **Amazon Fraud Detector**: Analyzes transaction data for suspicious activities.

## Architecture
1. **Input**: Audio files, transaction data, and VKYC videos/images.
2. **Processing**:
   - Transcription of calls.
   - Sentiment and keyword analysis.
   - Face and deepfake detection.
   - Transaction anomaly detection.
3. **Output**: Alerts for suspicious activities, real-time blocking, and feedback-driven improvement.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-calls-vkyc-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-calls-vkyc-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables for the application:
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Name of the S3 bucket for storing transcription results.
- `TRANSCRIPTION_JOB_NAME`: Unique name for the transcription job.
- `FRAUD_DETECTOR_ID`: ID of the Amazon Fraud Detector.

## Usage
1. Start the transcription process for an audio file:
   ```python
   from main import transcribe_audio
   response = transcribe_audio("https://example.com/audiofile.mp3")
   print(response)
   ```

2. Analyze transcription for fraud indicators:
   ```python
   from main import analyze_transcription
   is_fraudulent = analyze_transcription("Example transcription text")
   print("Fraud detected:", is_fraudulent)
   ```

3. Detect faces and deepfake indicators in VKYC:
   ```python
   from main import detect_faces
   with open("example_image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
       response = detect_faces(image_file.read())
       print(response)
   ```

4. Analyze transaction patterns:
   ```python
   from main import analyze_transaction_pattern
   transaction_data = {
       "customer_id": "12345",
       "timestamp": "2025-01-26T12:00:00Z",
       "amount": "1000.00",
       "location": "New York"
   }
   response = analyze_transaction_pattern(transaction_data)
   print(response)
   ```

## Success Metrics
- Spam call and deepfake detection accuracy: >95%.
- Fraudulent VKYC approvals reduction: >90%.
- Real-time analysis latency: <5 seconds.
- Financial fraud reduction: >85%.
